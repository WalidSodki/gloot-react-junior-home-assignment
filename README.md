# Gloot react junior home assignment

### By Walid Sodki

To to be able to use Sass I installed the node-sass npm package and configurated fuse and its plugins to make it work. No CSS libraries or frameworks used - everything is styled using Sass and flexbox.

An additional API call is made per GameCard component to the free image API unsplash.com to generate a random image for each game in the library.

The Roboto font is loaded in from Google Fonts.

## Getting started

All commands should be run from this projects root directory.

1. Clone this project with git.
2. Open a terminal window and run `npm i && npm run server` to start the node.js backend server.
3. Open another terminal window and run `npm start` to start the react web application.
4. Visit `localhost:4444` in your browser.

The web application and the backend server will update automatically when the source files changes. The backend server is running on port `3000`. The server data (i.e. the list of games) will be restored on a server restart.
